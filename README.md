Understanding various facets of human health and lifestyle depends on the analysis of health data. In this report,
we discuss the findings from the dataset obtained from Palechor & Manotas that looked at a person’s health
conditions, with a particular emphasis on the association between nutrition status and frequency of physical activity.
The dataset includes details about each person’s gender, age, height, weight, frequency of eating, and more.
We saw in the grouped bar chart that the prevalence of overweight and obesity was higher in both males
and females who frequently consumed high-calorie food than in those who did not. This shows a connection
between eating habits and nutritional status. The graphic also showed that compared to women, men had a higher
prevalence of obesity. Furthermore, most males consuming high caloric food suffer from obesity type II while
females consuming high caloric food suffer most from obesity III.
Another bar chart is used to explore the relationship between obesity level and the frequency
of physical activity. The bar chart highlighted the variation in physical activity frequency among the different
gender. And it is observe that males are more susceptible to being obese despite the fact that they do physical
activities frequently. This could be explained by the fact that doing physical activities while consuming high caloric
food does not stop an individual from being obese, a healthy diet is also required and the type of active also matters.
The results of the analysis of the obesity data give important information about how eating habit and physical
activity frequency interact. According to the research, eating behaviours and physical exercise are both crucial for
preserving a healthy weight and general well being . It is necessary to have a healthy diet while doing physical
activities.These findings can be used to inform public health programmes and programmes that encourage healthy living
and fight obesity. Policy makers and medical experts can assist people in making educated decisions and forming
healthy habits by focusing on high-calorie food intake and encouraging regular physical activity.
Since this analysis is based on a specific dataset, it’s possible that it doesn’t fully account for the diversity of the
population. It is necessary to do more in-depth analysis and study using larger and more varied datasets to confirm
these results and investigate additional variables that may affect physical activity and nutritional habit.
